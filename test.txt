I started cuts out of a need you know my boss kicked me out of a meeting and he said Hey Stephen that shirt you're wearing to the boardroom isn't
professional enough for despair like sorry Stephen you can't be a part of me and they're here leave at that moment I realized hey there's a there's an
opportunity for a professional shirt but one that was uh you know didn't wrinkle
and could still felt like you could move and that became the principles to everything we do today
[Music]
welcome back to another episode of you are not your rose we have the man with the plan the category creator of work
Leisure Stephen Borelli Stephen thank you for joining the show appreciate to be here I'm excited to
rock with you guys let's do it yeah yeah absolutely so where's this podcast find you today
I am in uh actually uh we just moved offices but uh I am in uh Marina Del Rey
in uh Los Angeles that's a beautiful area I was just I was at a conference the the geek out was
really close to their estate out there it's a really wonderful area it's beautiful out there yeah um you you're
actually from Washington correct yep from a small town called Wenatchee
Washington outside of uh Seattle oh amazing beautiful but you went to school at SD State correct
San Diego State yep yeah let's go what'd you study I studied uh
business marketing integrated marketing and I think is what they called it and the uh I also had a lot of fun there I
was really involved on campus was in a fraternity to uh I was you know one of
those social guys anything I could do to have fun uh and I I think San Diego State is I think it's a great school for
entrepreneurship because like the classes no one really takes that serious
but what you what kind of emulates the real world is uh you're around a lot of
like hungry kids that are more like first principle thinkers in a way where they're you know they're they're thinking about how do I do as little as
possible in class so I can have fun uh which was sort of like me but uh it kind
of I think it's a similar simulate uh similarities to being a founder and CEO or that that that training kind of works
um and and then you're also around people that you know out of San Diego State you have blenders knock around uh
puravita move their watches if you have a lot of yeah companies that came out of there and so I I was lucky enough to be
like the younger brother to a lot of those companies I was four years younger than a lot of the older guys that had started their businesses and I was like
man I gotta do that so I'm really grateful for my time at San Diego State yeah I love it that's amazing what uh
you see you were Greek what was your fret I was in uh SAE amazing love it amazing
um so I do a bunch of research on everybody before they come on you have an incredible IG and you just you just
nuked it what happened just no time for the the Instagram anymore you have a post on there forever oh Oh I thought
you said I got rid of it ah no no no but you haven't posted almost like a year or at least it was like six months I think
it was a great yeah well I posted it into the end of year one but uh you know running a business uh getting I'm
engaged now my personal stuff uh you know this 2022
was probably one of the more challenging up and down years of a lot of group we we had a ton of a big growth year for us
but also you know we launched women's we added all these other opportunities which we'll get into it when we get into
the nitty-gritty but an opportunity also can be a cost it's a cost center as well he's preparing for all of those and kind
of see how it adjusts to the businesses can be a challenge so I think uh we had a lot of learnings a lot of success but
we think 23 is going to be our best one yet oh I love that I absolutely love that
um so you did some work with pops right at the the West Coast Apple sales like what did
you what'd you learn their slinging apples that's it was a really interesting because that was essentially the start of your entrepreneurship
career right yeah I was desperate where I was like I can't go work for someone
and so uh I my dad was like Hey if you want to work we can you know you'll be
on a commission only and uh he was like I'll give you you know I think it was
like to start like a thousand bucks a month but I had to move home and I was like well at least a thousand bucks a
month more than I'm saving up my full-time job making you know 50 Grand you know I barely had enough to pay my
bills in San Diego so I was like even that is a good way to start so I did that I was able to get my commissions up
for working for my dad to a decent amount where living at home having a burn rate of zero where I was able to
put all the money back into the business uh and and like I call it 2015 to 2017
was like year zero like I I had a lot of brain energy not a lot going on I wasn't dating didn't uh didn't do a lot
um and I just focused on learning e-commerce and and finding the right fabric for cuts and um uh that was those
were really instrumental years where I could save I think each year I was saving 50 60 70 000
um of those two years to really put that money into Cuts so I uh it was it was uh
it was really the Kickstart of of cuts moving uh my dad I would also say one of my big learnings there to answer your
question was you know Apple's is is a high replenishment good like if you get
a client you know that client's gonna be around my dad has clients for like 30 years
um and he just provides a good service good quality and it's something people need and I when I was moving home I was
I was still like maybe I'll do watches maybe I'll do this or that yeah and when I thought of shirts I was like you know
what this is really something that hasn't been now you see a lot of econ businesses out there that I do t-shirts
but uh you know our Cuts was really the innovator of that and uh it was really
because it had a high replenishment item even uh even though it was going to be hard because you're going to have online
returns and stuff like that so um but I I felt like I could be the best in the world of doing that
yeah I mean anecdotally you are I have my cuts on right now and these are the you will
take these payments out of my dead cold hands like these it's it's really interesting to see how you've been able
to make a beachhead in terms of t-shirts that was kind of what you guys were known for but now you've expanded into
this really pretty robust product line now as you said you added on women's as well which is just a whole nother Market opening
but uh we'll get into that some more but I love it so how did you stay because I love the day Zero idea it's a little bit
or year zero it's kind of the same same as yeah but different with the the Bezos day Zero stuff but I love the idea of
being able to focus and there's you touched on something a little earlier about opportunity costs and there is
definitely something to be said about you know putting your head down for a couple years and just Biting Down on the
mouthpiece how did you stay focused how did you just stay hungry like how how did you keep kind of that that excitement going because I'm not a big
believer in motivation I think motivation is fickle and I think like discipline is probably a better Vector
where you can actually discipline a routine in in a weird way like routine gives you Freedom how do like how did
you structure your day your life around being you know going from slinging apples for a thousand dollars to a
hundred million dollar company that's quite the jump yeah I was really on my motivation in 2013 through 2015 you know watching all
the gurus out there which I think you do that when you you almost don't know where to go but then once I start cuts
on that kind of stopped all of that um because I didn't I didn't need any more um I didn't need any more inspiration
but um my days were you know you can ask my mom
or dad they would tell you this I would wake up Apple business was all East Coast based so I had to be up at six on the phones
and I would do that from like six to eleven yeah and then I'd be done eat lunch and then I would have a few every
now and then I would have calls after 11 but that was the working hours six six a.m to 11. so then I would usually you
know grab lunch and um it was great the one thing great about being home was my
dad's office was like kind of attached to the house the Wenatchee small town you have lots of acreage so he kind of
built like a a two-person office right and so every day at lunch my mom would make me food I would get recharged and
then I would work literally to like 10 pm at night and so I've got too tired and then I would wake up and do that
over again and you know I just I was like all right get through 11 make make the sales make some money and then uh
the rest of the day uh I would I would be working uh on cuts and I think in those early years being at home really
helped me because I was so desperate to get out of being here 3526 you know like I was desperate Sprint I
was like all my friends are having girlfriends and stuff like this or you know they're making 100 200k dude making
you know making a life for themselves and I'm sitting at home being the guy that's gonna create t-shirts it didn't
sit with me right and so I think like every day at home was one day I didn't have that so it really forced me to be
like Stephen okay what else do you need to do today and I think going back to your prior point where I used to be was
I used to be that guy that was like high motivation but not a lot of output um yes before that one story I don't I
think this is the first time I've said it on a podcast I actually got let go of three
consecutive jobs I was working at lambisis they did layoffs they they caught me then I went to this real
estate company that ended up being like I still to this day think so it was like a a money laundering or something super
sketchy it was there a month and I was like I gotta get out of here then I worked for about five months for my for
this other startup called brochure which it was it was we were this I was the second employee they were kind of
stumbling around it was this Rich lady that wanted this idea and she hired two college kids and then they let me go and
at that point I was like I was really fortunate enough to be like Steven whatever you're doing right now it's not
working so part of going home was just to reset and be like we need a big reset
like I need a reset here I need to get back to like the business fundamentals of of you know my personal life like
what was Stephen really gonna do and I had to be like really I always say humility can overcome experience
uh can make up for experience if you have humility and what uh because it humidity will drive you to being really
curious which can overcome a lack of experience sorry that was kind of Twisted but
um that can you know and that's really what happened I I was so curious that I I knew I didn't know anything which and
I was really humble on that so it really drove me to finding the truth of you know how to make the best T-shirt and
reaching out to people and understanding what a pattern maker is all those little things I think I wouldn't have been as
receptive to but at that time and just nothing was working I wasn't making any money and I just you know I had to
rethink everything and I'm fortunate to go through that experience I love that man I I had a similar kind
of trajectory myself where I ended up coming out of school and then I ended up getting so I used to sell shoes at uh
Nordstrom women's shoes and I ended up getting in gradually yeah he's just playing slang words too in college
let's go yeah college and then I graduated my economics degree back to Indianapolis and uh I got the same job
and it was very very awkward and it just ate me up inside and I did the kind of same thing of like dude this isn't the
path Robert you're meant for more blah blah blah you have your little pity party and you can go one of two ways you can say hey is this going to be my life
forever is this day one or one day kind of thing you just but I I really love the idea I think sometimes and
again this is kind of speaking from privileged backgrounds where it's like I had the ability to go back and live with my mom which was which was great because
there's just something about man having to work like a nine to five especially when it's just that brain dead job of
like you want to kill yourself and you're just clock watching that can be really challenging so I really like the idea of that reset if you have that
ability to just have that introspection and say Hey you know I'm in control of my life I'm writing my movie what do I
want this movie to be and I think when you simplify your life and minimize it's
an easier way to see the path forward versus when you have all these little things kind of Nick and that you can be
challenging or to your point like the Allure of comfort right of like if
you're just comfortable enough you don't want to make the change and so I I love that and I really really think the
humility thing is I'm a big believer in beginner's mind and uh humility because
it not only is it just kind of a more fruitful way to live it removes a lot of judgment where it's just like I don't
know everything like I wanted I want to learn and do these things but I don't need to come from a place of like anger or hate or anything like that because I
don't know it it's like oh cool you just made me better thank you so I think it's just a a really beautiful way to
experience life and again it look at what you've been able to do with that philosophy like it's it's really I think
a a very very viable pathway for a lot of people and I've always said too like
right now is probably the best time to be exceptional in the worst time to be average where it's like if you have the
drive and you want to do something like there's so many resources available to you where in you know 50s 60s 70s like
you kind of you kind of lose there was some challenges like the library was the most exciting thing that you could get
into which libraries are great but now you think of the internet YouTube Tick Tock there's all these things that can really explode your skill set at a very
low cost which I think is really cool yeah and I think young young people like
you should you know not be not be afraid of getting laid off or not be afraid of taking an L on an
experience that didn't work out I think that's the time you figure out and I I really got to the point of after that I
was like man I can't be 40 and someone lets me go with the family like that that doesn't seem like a a an
opportunity that I want to do so um at you know I think for for us uh
that was really for me specifically that was huge to to realize that at such a young age like for me to feel good about
my career it's not going to be I gotta put in my own hands and so that was another element of those layoffs like it
just beat me down you know thank God I had a family then it could kind of move home with
um and kind of reset with because that was you know really it was a difficult time going through it but then yeah as
the third one came I'm like I'm good and it actually with my layoffs true because we've done this you know cuts and things
like that yeah and you know because it's it's people that I you know that drives
business and it breaks my heart every time you have to you know go on either it wasn't a right fit or you know we're
moving to a different opportunity um you know now I'm just like you know what it may hurt them now but you know
Cuts was a good you know couple months or a year or whatever they're gonna be fine um you know it allows me to do it a
little bit quicker than I think I would have if I hadn't actually been laid off myself yeah that's beautiful man I love how you
integrate the the lessons of the past to make a better you in the future um okay amazing one last question and
then we'll move on to the value add segment what's the nicest thing someone's known for you
I would say you know my mom specifically my dad too but my mom uh my mom when you
know I would when I was born and go to school she would always say you're destined God said you're destined to do something great you know she would say
that she said she told me a story for my whole life that was like when you were born like I had this message you know
given to me um by God and I think like I really believe like I was destined to do
something that a few men have done and it's beautiful I always held on to that
when opportunities didn't work out like I was destined like we were gonna figure this out and it gave me an abundance of
confidence but rooted in reality too like I wasn't yes she did it wasn't pompous confidence it was like
you know I see that guy I think I can do that too you know or it gave me like you can do it attitude
um and I think like those words when you're a kid like you know you believe your mom you love your mom and um uh but
you know there's no no mountain we I can't climb and you know she also said Hey Stephen you're now working hard too
like yeah yeah yeah not working it wasn't like I was uh you know giving
this unrealistic self-confidence but uh you know I think that was really the best gift because that's really gotten
me far I love that man yeah it's it's super helpful to be reminded of your potential
and also coming from somebody that you love and that you know is that also but I think it's also great to not have that
toxic positivity that's like one of my pet peeves of like dude if she's not going good like just like hey you know
this isn't life forever but like we need to fix it or like pivot out of this because this isn't producing the outputs
that we want and there that doesn't take away from your potentiality but you're just not re realizing it so why don't we
try these other Pathways but and I I almost feel like I need to say this every January every econ fashion
specifically it thinks the world's coming down on them so I might be in one of those right now after
yeah absolutely and that also like permeates I think across most d2c brands
unless you're in kind of like a health Vector where everybody spent all their money in Q4 and like well we need to kind of yeah
exactly yeah yeah 100 um all right this is why the people bought the ticket this is a value add
segment um we kind of touched on it a little bit but but let's let's kind of drill down into it a little bit why did
you start cuts and why is it called that I started Cuts uh out of a need you know
my boss kicked me out of a meeting and he said Hey Stephen that shirt you're wearing to the boardroom isn't professional enough for Dasani was
coming in and I was one of their account managers and uh they were like sorry Stephen you can't be a part of me and
they're here leave and uh at that moment I realized hey there's a there's an
opportunity for a professional shirt but one because he was wearing a t-shirt but
one that was uh you know didn't wrinkle and could still felt like you could move and that became the principles to
everything we do today so um you know that's why we did it and then the cuts was I knew I needed a spin
I was like there needs to be a spin and I was like well you know my buddy had a long torso so he liked the elongated I
have a short torso so I wanted like a smaller curve yeah and then you know my buddy also like always wore these split
hand shirts uh underneath like a a like an open like flannel but he loved the
split him because he cut layered so I was like you know what we're gonna launch Cuts t-shirts Cuts would be
t-shirts and you'll be able to shop by cut so it's lit it's literally cool and
it has that punch Cuts Cuts yeah because I went to I went to uh Nordstrom I used
to work there and there was like all this I almost named it Stephen David which is my first and middle name and I was like I'm just gonna be another
brand that's this that's a that's a name and uh I just felt like that wasn't
catchy uh and I really wanted a four-letter word which was you know Nike uh you know there's a lot of Sony big
iconic brands with four letters yeah and actually we went to get the trademark and Jay Cutler had cut apparel and so he
was super nice he he signed this document so we both could exist in this in this world and when I got it I was like okay we got something here
the the OG uh quarterback that he used to play for the the Bears no the
bodybuilder the bodybuilder oh okay okay okay okay okay yeah tracking that's a really cool story man that is a
really cool story how about that do you have you ever interacted with that boss again
you know what I've never seen him before oh my boss you know what's funny about
it because you could have been many so I got fired from that company and uh
my boss 25 me says Stephen and he said it too which was pretty cool he's like Stephen you're special but uh we're just
cool kind of like an agency world if you lost a client the whole team left yeah and he was like you're gonna do something great it's just not here uh
that's cool and and uh
and I think uh you know that really gave me confidence but now Cuts has more employees in that business so that's
kind of cool that's awesome coming up on top
um how did you so you kind of touched on this but I kind of want you started something called the Friday project
stuff what is that or kind of tell the people what's going on there because that's kind of a cool little initiative
we're actually in the process of changing now that we have women's we put it on a pause to relaunch it in April okay okay but up to this point through
four years it was our so two things in the DDC Community will like this on uh
front end for customers it was our hype opportunities colors we wouldn't normally do you know collabs with with
artists uh uh products that like are like why would Cuts do that
so it's a way to driving excitement really low units really high intent to buy creates hey if you don't get on at 9
27 16 you're not gonna get it we the reason we launched it at 9 27 16 is we
launched our Kickstarter on 9 27 2016 so that's one little Hidden Gem there oh
that's cool yeah it's just the time we launch it so but on the back end it's our testing
ground for ads and stuff so like for joggers we were like cuts through pants we launched them in boom they sold out
in a day so we're like okay now we can order units with high degree of certainty and that's interesting and
we're able to test like Facebook we're able to test things on a rapid basis so there's there's lots of things like that
that I think um DDC people can can use two angles it's
hype and it's a a rapid weekly testing ground to find new winners for low cost
that's really fascinating so not only are you leveraging community but you're leveraging essentially prospects that
would then and then you hit measure the intensity that is real that's actually really clever idea behind that I love
the little Easter egg too that's on the iPhone if you look at the calendar app and also on the Mac that's when the
iPhone dropped if you look at the little date on there where they have that so um you're in good company with cool
little Easter eggs that's dope yeah I really really like that a lot um how did you get like how did you
skill yourself up to be such a wizard in terms of apparel cuts no pun intended
Fabrics supply chain etc etc sounds like you really have your head around that was that in your formative period when
you're really kind of delving down into Cuts or did you just start adding more and more stuff in terms of the knowledge
base yeah I mean we uh we like I don't think it's that hard to
do fashion you know it's just like it's just not or or e-commerce I think that for any product it's it's not as hard as
people make it out to be um you just have to have you have to really know consumer behavior and under and and be like that kind of have a lot
of humility and be really curious and be okay with being wrong if you can have that then it can lead you to what
customers want and I think where I was thinking about this last night I was listening to a podcast and they were
saying you know as a as an individual you need to figure
out what your strengths are and I was like you know what I've been in the business well what is what are what are my like one of one strengths and I think
from a merchandising standpoint understanding what products to come out with when and how to make those I'm like
one of the best in the world at now um and everything else in the business I've hired people to do that are much more uh
skilled than me but that's the one thing that I still bring to the business of cuts
um and I unders and I have so much learned to room to grow in that uh field
um so that was uh that's something that that I I still do but does that answer
the question yeah absolutely and I'm gonna steal that I really like that one-on-one strength I
think that's a really good indicator especially when you get into leadership positions you can't everybody's gonna
want your time everybody's gonna want this everybody doesn't want that but as you start to accrue more resources
um delegation is really important because you can't hire out for some of these things right like you I mean maybe
you could but to your point not to the degree that you can do that where you can't hire somebody to put the vision of
your company you can't hire somebody for these things and that one-of-one strength is a really cool mental model for me I like that a lot
um what are your thoughts on because you guys are not on Amazon
what are your thoughts on Amazon as an organization Channel I just Sean over at rage always has given
me a hard time with this hilarious with with other big uh uh CEOs and I
think uh for us even you know we'll battle this but uh
Revenue isn't always so Sean at uh Ridge is right we'll get more Revenue there's
there's people bidding on our keywords in that but Revenue isn't just the only thing that makes a brand last forever so
like we just feel like where we want to go is we want to be full direct to Consumer you can buy it on our site and
you can buy it on on our own stores which we're launching soon as well as a
few selected on brand uh wholesalers that really are uh uh batching our brand
ethos so you know two things can be true one Amazon will
generate significant additional Revenue there's no doubt about that but also it
could hurt the brand long term and I I never I'm never a definitive guy hell no you know it's not it's not something we
want right now it's something we Pro we don't feel like is right for us right now doesn't mean forever like in if our
BR like I use Nike for example they're sold in Nordstroms and they're sold lots of other places they build up enough and they also have
high and low price points LeBron shoes 100 and something bucks you can buy a Nike for 40 bucks they they compete
multiple uh consumer uh segments and price points so we're just not there yet
um to be diluting the brand but one day I think we could but it's just now right now
I I absolutely love that answer so I just uh was listening to uh the business
breakdowns podcast fantastic podcast if you guys haven't listened to it and they did it on uh Hermes which is just a
super crazy fashion brand super fancy brand uh it actually came from Saddles
um back in the day in the 1800s just generational but the whole point to tie it together is that your point of
Revenue isn't King is so interesting so they sold a bunch of uh bags in um so
they're famous for the birken bag the Kelly bag what have you and they had a lower level bag that was selling my gangbusters in Japan and they actually
ripped it off the shelves because it was to your point like you could think of it almost the same thing as the Amazon
channel for you guys where it was starting to become this brand dilution that the people that Hermes wanted to
sell to and that wanted to be dressed in like the brand Equity loss was not worth that Revenue that they were gaining so I
think it's a really cool way to think of it like obviously you need Revenue you need these things of that nature but to
your point there's I think people shy away from this too much where there's a certain aspect
obviously you don't want to be too exclusionary but there is a certain aspect of like building your tribe and like these are the people we want to
support these are the people that and like that there is so much value to that and it starts to really I think pay for
itself and ultimately I think that is one of the manifestations of brand right like you think of like people that wear Cuts you have this really clear picture
of who wants to do it who why they do it what they do these things of that nature so I think that's a really interesting
take uh I like that take a lot actually yeah and yeah we have a Discord that's
got 3 000 people in it um we have we our community is huge for us so I think like we're serving our
community like it you know and I I just think without getting consumer data and and all of this like that they take is
for us too big of a a cost you know make but again one day I know aloe and uh
some other brands use it as a as like their Discount Center so they they put skus
that they over ordered there um that could be a route for us one day um but uh right now it's not so
yeah that's really well put and so you you kind of teased it there a little bit but what you see you guys are opening
some retail stores or what's your take on retail yeah I mean I think it's going to be
huge for businesses like you know viewers a brand that we look up to yeah kind of similar stories they establish
with men's and now women's is crushing for them they had one item in the course where we had one item and they they had
a lot of good uh execution after that I think for us
um you know were uh we want to bring cuts to the physical world I mean create that
environment so we're probably doing a little bit slower than people would have thought but uh you know we want to build
a store that we're proud of and it's going to cost a little bit more yeah than just by get like you know there's a
lot of Brands they all look the same when you go in their retail stores it's like minimum viable product and I I
don't hate that model but for us just to we want to be on brand and really think about it in the right way so we're
taking our time with it no I love that that's amazing um what are the best parts and hardest
parts of running cuts the people the best parts are the people
and the hardest parts of the People by far
you know that's it you know the people in here I love to grind for and I love to be with like I don't even like going
on vacations I just like showing them to the office every day um but also sometimes you have people
that aren't part of that tribe that you have to kind of move for a minute or a thorn in your butt so that's uh that's
the hard part I mean that's like the the culture aspect but I would say from like a more technical aspect of of running a
direct consumer businesses uh probably just like from a bootstrap
business managing cash flow like if you're growing as fast as you are without taking outside money like
we just learned how to run a business on on strapped cash like it's get it's gotten much better over the years don't
get me wrong but in the early days like you know even even over 10 million in
sales are in you know we needed HBO to do while we were out so
um you know just managing cash and making sure that like that's the hardest part about being in the business and
even to this day it feels like sometimes especially q1 where you know
it's it's tight you know so yeah you know it sets you to save bootstrapped but it it's also a big burden on the
founders because you know you have to make good decisions at that point um to be successful so
now that's really well put I think that they're like I I'm much in the camp of
you as well like if you can do bootstrap that's incredible well I guess it a depends on your goal right like what is your goal if your goal is to have this
crazy growth at all costs hockey stick exit that's one thing and then you're gonna need kind of capital because
you're going to be acquiring at inefficient rates but you're just going to be exiting on the growth I don't know if that window exists anymore where the
last four to six years it did where if you could just show somebody up into the right look at my Revenue I don't care about the CAC
um but I do take your point of that um you're definitely more on that knife's edge when you're bootstrapped to
where uh you know the the bets you need to place need to be really well thought out and they need to be like the number
one reason startups die is because they run out of cash and so like being able to understand that cash flow I think is
definitely a super super top of mine um what was your first hire
my first hires I I think that was one of the things we did well on it was our he was a Director of Finance at a hospital
but he come from the world of accounting so he just made sure our books weren't ordering and that's something I'm
horrible with made sure we have enough money for the next PO on simple basis he was the money guy then the next one was an operations person who could run
operations of the business and predict when we would need inventory and all that and uh that huge huge I see so many
I talked to so many sub 20 million dollar brands that like they can't grow because they don't have like demand
planning figured out um so like get your one of those if you're listening like make that a
priority and the third one was a guy that was good with the camera someone that could take photos for our website and could take photos for ads
and we had a little nucleus and that's like really all you needed and then I I did product development and I you know Facebook ads and all that
um and we had our team and so I think like like even to this day we joke about it uh we could go to that team right now
now granted product development was so on and things like that but we could go to that Razer thin if a rainy day came
so um you know those are those are things we could do yeah those are three three clutch hires
how big is the team now estimated or guesstimate uh around uh with so we're
90 of all teams are in the office but customer service and some uh
a few roles that like just don't need to be here but product and marketing is mainly in here we're around 50. oh
that's great yeah that's a really nice it's a really nice um what do you see or or actually first
question and then the next question um well what Frameworks or productivity systems do you guys use because it's what I was reading is you're a little
bit of okr guy is that is that correct well yeah yeah we're we're so we are
okrs but I would say where we struggled initially is when you you download uh you know the software that okay our
software you do it exactly and then sometimes there's good theories and then
there's good execution and I think as a Founder you got to be like oh well put Simple Solution so like we simplify we
put our okrs up but you know how in an okr statement it has to really true up to that and this you have to watch the
way the statements are if the statement's wrong it maybe doesn't make it's kind of okr but it's it's a a key
result you know all this Nuance to it and I think what we realize is we're a small business let's just put our goals
up there and then the things to achieve the key results to achieve those goals and we're not gonna like
fill out the percentages of oh is it 40 like let's keep the solution simple so
we do a simplified version of okrs that's like here our goal is by
um by a category in the business and then let's achieve those goals on it on a weekly monthly uh yearly basis and um a
lot of them change and you know I think rapid results is what I always say to the team like uh that's that's kind of
e-com in a nutshell um so I would say Okay ours is kind of how we structure it as well as just
great people that know what winning looks like uh and that's a small set that I look for is like do you know does
this employee know what winning looks like in their given field and it's actually something like is I try to
remind people of like okay do you know what you need to be doing every day to win and what is the results of winning
and like even that like we've gotten bigger and like I I can sense it in the office like okay people don't know we I
gotta get back to it so I'm big into just Simple Solutions like having leaders that know what to tell people to
do to be successful I I man I couldn't be more on board with that we're rolling out okrs here at
triple well and I think that bifurcation that you just made of theory versus execution it's so on the nose
um because so for people that don't know what we're talking about their objectives and key results um so you would have X objective and
then the key results are either a milestone with a date or some sort of quantitative thing of like driving x
amount of revenues or something like that um it so this is from Andy Grove at Intel
and then Google was famous for them I want to like them more but candidly to
your point I prefer the Simplicity of almost like a kpi of like here's where we want to go how do we get there and
just run versus like you can get caught up in some of this intellectual masturbation well is that really an
objective or is that a okay it's like dude let's just yeah and Crush like like so I I'm totally in your Camp there and
I I love the because I have that same so we have four people in the office here and I can feel that same thing as well
like almost that spidey sense of like is everybody running the right direction or there seems to be like this person's going that way that person's this way or
there's just total confusion and I I love that you have that because being that that's one of the things moving
into a leadership position that was so unique for me because I used to just be in ic individual contributors the the
fancy term for people that don't know um and that was like I could care less about the team or anything like I just
want to build and crush and do these things and then you get in a leadership position you're like oh my gosh like you have to keep to your point of like the
best and the worst right it's people like you have to keep people happy there's always something Billy's mad at Sally Sally's mad at Susie and then
you're always like it's just this year whatever it is yeah it gets into some very unique
things of like what all right let's just build guys let's just build them so uh that's amazing okay I know we got eight
minutes left so let's run through one more question then we have some fan questions uh how do you see the next two
to three years unfolding for e-commerce I think we're seeing it in ours like uh
just the ones that have communities are going to survive I think uh you know so
that's the first thing you really got to be Community focused and have a good product if you have a good product Community your growth might slow down a
little bit as the algorithms change but you can do it and then the ones that prioritize really good content to drive
their acquisition sales which has been a huge Focus for us uh I would also say
I'm really bullish on meta this year more than last year I think a lot of people
make it out to be like Doomsday I think the Anti-Trust laws are going to come back and give data points maybe not as
many but like they already gave us a thousand I think if I think if apple is starting to see how bad that hurts small
businesses to advertise and I could see that some type of agreement like Google and apple have an agreement I think
maybe the agreement with meta would come back you know and hopefully forced in by the government because but even without
even with that the current way I still think Apple but Facebook or meta is is
getting used to the new normal so I'm bullish I also think Tick Tock uh bad
platform is in its empathy that's going to get better yep uh you know shorts you know theirs is getting better and better
um so I think these businesses are highly incentivized they see the the type of revenues that you can get by
being a good platform and been delivering for your clients and you know more and more people are consuming
content that way so um you know I am a little bit more bullish on that I mean everyone says
that hey they're not on Instagram anymore and I it's just not the case Instagram is like the one tried and true
thing that you're going to go on just to check up on your friends and so uh I'm a little more bullish than people on that
I guess I'm I'm not as bullish like if you asked me this last year to say influencer is going to crash I think the
way in which influencer was done where you you've seen and then they talk about your product I just think is it's not as compelling
to learn through an influencer anymore um the the cost ratio isn't worth it so
uh I think people you're gonna have to get really crafty how you you gain that uh
credibility through the influencer it's gonna have to be even more detailed than before I think like you know Grant like
brand Partners year-long relationships that are really not that are more like long payback periods but the short-term
payback period of post and you see sales I just don't I mean we've seen it we probably spent more than
95 of companies out there on influencers in 2020 uh too and I think we're
starting to see a huge decline in that so up in meta down an influencer uh and Google Google's been big too Google's
been really good yeah yep exactly uh no those are great tickets man
oh yeah those are super strong takes those are uh that's exactly what we're seeing what's a ton of data
I would say uh micro influencer as well where it's just free product for a link
on a growing person like that that's that's where you're going to find good value at scale but you're gonna need
scale and influencer to do well don't look and this is where Cuts biggest learning for last year was don't look
for uh don't look for home runs it's gambling influencers gambling and like in 2022 don't gamble so we we're not
gambling in 22. or 23. yeah no I love that I mean you saw that with Addison Ray right like her all her stuff's
getting pulled from Sephora and stuff like that and she's arguably one of the biggest influencers in the world and like without a product like you said I
think you can't have a great brand without a great product and then without a community with people to evangelize it gets really challenging and then what I
like about your point about the micro influencers is that um you can make more bets it's like when
you pay an influencer 20 25k you're like dude this needs to net out where it's just like here's here's 500 bucks and
some free product let's let's make a hundred of these bets and if those things bet out like I I love that that's
that's really really well put okay I know we're pushing up against it so let's get one question in from the fans and then I got the overview
okay okay so the first one I have I have to ask it so your uh work from home take
that that caught you some heat uh actually was like I deleted it because
it was I was like man I think this might reach like CNN or something where like they're gonna you know I mean I I was I
I really I really did an unfiltered take where I just went and when what I didn't
because I knew uh viral twitters is I didn't really realize that people could retweet like
without context the whole thread and one of my threads was like you know uh
it was like you know uh the drive you know you're driving from work like suck it up like you know
you'll learn from that and I met I meant like when I used to do it came out of context like I was the biggest
your take was hey like if you're early in your career and you're in your and you're committed to something and you're
and you're struggling that's that's kind of it's as a young person it's it's a good thing now if you're a single mom
and a lot of single moms and things like that kind of ripped it like oh work from homes allowed me be with my kids and stuff so I totally get that my sister
works from home uh and she's really blessed by it but my intent was that when you're in the office magic can
happen you know employees can share ideas much easier and if you're a young employee this is the biggest point you
should strive to be want to be in the office because success in progress isn't up and down it's sometimes side to side
you might get to know someone on a water break that from a different department and then that's your startup founder
five years later you know so there's lots of other things in my opinion that can come from building relationships in
the office but then That's from the employee standpoint from the from the uh I think depends on the product like Sean
at Ridge can do it really well he can you know his product is a little bit more simple but for cuts making close
touch and feel fit is important um you know where Billy all this stuff it's so much easier in person
um and and I'm a leader that likes to lead with my hands with my voice with
checking in I'm not a guy to take and I get 15 minutes on your calendar Zoom I'm not a good leader like that so I think
and I'm a betting man that most companies go back it'll be like the 80 20. most companies will do really go
back into office most of the time and not have a lot of success there's a small companies that are going to be able to be better based on product and
fit that could do uh remote but in the
next three years you'll see like 80 of companies be returned to office yeah I mean I I used to be a big work
from home Maxi I did it for multiple multiple years and now that I've been in the office there is something about just
the idea sex that happens people just bumping up and chew each other um and I do think that there's there's
you know a nice modulation of so we're the Austin team in Pacific we're just butts and seats ten to three Monday
through Thursday and Friday's a flex day so it's like this nice hybrid of like we get the idea sex but at the same time
you get some flexibility in your schedule you want to work from a coffee shop do that what have you but um I I'm with you on that I thought you
caught too much heat for that take as well I thought it was I know Texas King I almost I should have left it but I was
like I don't because I'm if I was well known and that was my first take I would have been like yeah just screw it screw
these people but when I read it I was like I was just unfiltered man I was just going for it and that's how I am in
the office but people took a lot of contact amazing all right I'm going to take you through your rapid fire really quickly
because I know you got a bump uh okay cool Tick Tock overrated underrated
can you what give me more Nuance with tick tock uh whether ads social just a platform in
general what do you how do you foresee it do you think it's overrated right now or underrated
oh that's a tough one uh overrated simply because I think in the
next three years it will be off the iPhone
yeah it's a hot take under radius underrated underrated I love the YouTube samsies uh Mount Rainier your Washington
guy overrated underrated underrated honestly I've traveled a lot
seeing that mountains beautiful on a sunny day in Seattle like it's hard to find that view anywhere else it just
dominates you right like it's beautiful very cool uh Chad gbt overrated underrated
underrated I think that steps
underrated for sure I love it you see Microsoft's about to put a boatload of cash into it okay
um we talked about this a little bit but work from home overrated underrated work from home underrated oh he's back
he's back people well wait wait I meant to say overrated I meant to say overrated
baby put the thread back up let's go definitely overrated yeah I love uh
Stephen you're the best um okay ours overrated underrated maybe overrated because they get such a
a bigger Roar and like we've definitely been in a business that's like over thought it and and so yeah
I couldn't agree with you more I totally agree there um apples the ones you eat overrated or underrated underrated all
this helps to kill this out in the world eat an apple a day yeah people come on
um retail overrated underrated underrated I still am a huge believer in it uh from a finance standpoint Cuts you
know it's a different business model but if if we did raise money that's why we would raise money you'd expand it to
that that makes tons of sense um if you could collab with anyone who would it be
yeah I I think collabs with influencers
there's only a few people in the world that can really make a difference this is going to be a hot take but
because man's uh we really worked with like Patrick Mahone like a lot of guys really wear it on an organic basis yeah
I would say because I want our women's to take off it's hard to not say one of the Jenners
Kylie Jenner yeah [Music] it prints they print you know the the
they are this uh like kind of Our Generations Oprah like they move the needles man they they really do they
they move the needles for sure um favorite piece of cuts clothing
our black crew black crew oh gee baby oh gee I love it that's made you more money
than anything else so I gotta go with that let's go let's go all right two more questions and I'll let you go um favorite place travel tune why
uh I'll give a couple one and a boys one uh
the I I uh I really love anywhere in Spain I just love the the culture it's
nice it's a nice uh you know I'm Cuban so I like going out there visiting
family I propose in Mallorca we're getting married in my Orca so it's it's a good it's a good life out there
um I think uh from a uh like if you're going with your boys if you like to golf
like something about being up at Pebble Beach and you know playing golf and in the cold going to the cabin and just
having your fireplace in the room I think they do a real good job for like just a kind of a your you and your boys
going out and play golf I love that yeah the silamar that whole area is just it's gorgeous it's really beautiful out there
okay last question um if you could have dinner with three people that are alive who are you inviting so there's a table
Steven sitting at the head who's getting the three invites uh
Dead or Alive Kobe
that pains me because I thought our paths would eventually cross and we were getting close but I was just a little
couple years too too late uh that's brutal JC Kobe who's the third
Jay-Z I guess you could go way back yeah you
can pull back way back I'm not a businessman I'm a business man
and Jay-Z is strong though I guess I mean maybe one day I'll make Jason yeah I'll all stick with that I'm
thinking maybe like Abe Lincoln or something cool like that but I don't know what I would talk to him about like
Jesus I get all of the historical contents of Life yeah what happened
oh because that's my athlete guy and then from the Arts and entertainment I think Jay-Z would be pretty cool to
because we would have a lot to talk about because he's still alive also entrepreneurial right I mean this man is built in Empire yeah I mean it's
a great one um I know we're pushing up against it so if you have to dip I can sign you sign you off yeah one more okay amazing
